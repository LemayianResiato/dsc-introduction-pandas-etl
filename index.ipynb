    "\n",
    "In this section, you will learn invaluable skills that will form the foundation of your data processing work. Before you can apply machine learning algorithms or do interesting analyses, you often must clean and transform your data into a suitable format. Such initial data wrangling processes are often referred to as Extract Transform Load (ETL). Our primary tool of choice for performing ETL and basic analyses will be the Pandas package.\n",

    "## Why ETL?\n",
    "\n",
    "ETL is an essential first step to data analysis and data science. It also will form the foundation for exploratory data analysis. Often, you will be thrown a dataset that you have little to no information about. In these cases, your first step is to explore the data and get familiar with it. What are the columns? How many observations do you have? Are there missing values? Any outliers? If we have user-level data, how can we explore aggregate trends along features like gender, race, or geography? All of these can be answered by applying ETL to transform raw datasets into alternative useful views. "

The bartenders suck - I've almost got in a fight with one because she was a complete bitch. Refused to serve me a drink because she was \"busy\" celebrating her friends birthday BEHIND THE BAR. This place is ridiculous. I will NEVER go there again.. EVER.\n",

       "3458    We were expecting amazing Thai food after all the reviews that we read and the fact that this place was voted one of the top 100 restaurants in Toronto. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was disappointing. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off, it was really awkward sitting on the benches outside on the sidewalk, as people walked past us while to wait for our table. \\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, when we were seated, it was so loud. It felt like we were in a high school cafeteria. There was so much noise from people talking over each other and from the loud music. We were just happy that we didn't have to share a table with another couple. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally - Food was mediocre. I was extremely disappointed with the curry egg noodle dish. It was awkward to eat and I felt sick about half way through because the curry was too rich. On the flip side - I had a taste of my company's dish and it wasn't that great either - he had the beef stir fry dish with rice. The meat was nice and tender, but it wasn't flavourful. \\r\\n\\r\\nWasn't worth the hype, unfortunately.\n",

Our family had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Gilchrist and his associate Alex today when they came by to assess our 14 year old dog. This was such a positive experience for our dog to be examined in the security of her home. We were given plenty of opportunities to ask any questions and our questions were thoroughly answered. We will definitely call Dr. Gilchrist again.   \n",
       "3028  Had to switch barbers because I moved and the place I used to go to didn't take appointments. Great old school barber shop that does the straight razor finish. You can make appointments online which is really convenient especially since I work a lot and don't have a lot of free time. Boris always cuts my hair and is great at what he does and also consistent. I never have to worry if it's going to be a good haircut and I'm kind of ocd about haircuts. I would definitely recommend this place.   \n",

Paper menu doubles as the placemat and you must seat yourself as well as add your own condiments one little packet at a time. Water was warm and waiters stood around chatting while our cups were empty. When tip was low due to mutiple failings the waitress thought it was her duty to advise us she expected 15% regardless.   \n",
